# A Simple Counter App!

This is a basic follow-along example for the students of Hack Reactor Austin's cohort 30. In it, we will be creating a React application with Redux/React-Redux. This empty boilerplate is created with 'create-react-app'. It does not include 'redux' and 'react-redux' which you will need to install by running the following in your terminal:
```
npm install --save redux
npm install --save react-redux
```

How to use:
```
npm install
npm start
```
